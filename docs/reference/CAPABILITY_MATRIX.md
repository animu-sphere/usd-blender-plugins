# Capability matrix

This page is the **only** document that says what is implemented. Every other
document describes intended behavior and links here.

As of 2026-10-01 nothing is implemented: the repository holds the
documentation baseline only.

Vocabulary:

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| supported | implemented, and a fixture proves it |
| approximated | implemented as the closest standard representation, with a diagnostic saying so |
| preserved | the source value is kept on the stage, not interpreted |
| unsupported | read and reported with a diagnostic, not authored |
| unverified | implemented, but no fixture proves it yet |
| — | nothing implemented |

No row says "supported" without a fixture.
