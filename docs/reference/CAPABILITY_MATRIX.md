# Capability matrix

This page is the **only** document that says what is implemented. Every other
document describes intended behavior and links here.

The tables below own capability status, not delivery status; phase status is in
the [roadmap table](../roadmap/README.md#status-at-a-glance).
Synthetic headers and the Blender-written `empty.blend` below live in
`plugins/usdBlendFileFormat/tests/fixtures/`;
the contributor-provided Blender file lives in `tests/corpus/` beside them.
Header validation does not establish scene compatibility. Fixture generation
requirements and evidence are in its
[provenance and checks](../../plugins/usdBlendFileFormat/tests/fixtures/README.md#blender-written-empty-scene);
build and test procedures are in [the build guide](../guides/building.md).

Vocabulary:

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| supported | implemented, and a fixture proves it |
| approximated | implemented as the closest standard representation, with a diagnostic saying so |
| preserved | the source value is kept on the stage, not interpreted |
| unsupported | read and reported with a diagnostic, not authored |
| unverified | implemented, but no fixture proves it yet |
| — | nothing implemented |

No row says "supported" without a fixture.

## 1. Container

| Capability | Status | Fixture | Intended in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.blend` registration (`usd-fileformat:blend`) | supported | `header_only.blend`; `empty.blend` | Phase 0 |
| legacy header | supported | `header_only.blend`; malformed header fixtures; `blendFile.header` | Phase 0 |
| Blender 5 header | supported | `empty.blend`; `blendFile.header`; `corpus/blender-5.2.2/Untitled.blend` | Phase 0 |
| legacy block layout | — | | Phase 1 |
| Blender 5 block layout | — | | Phase 1 |
| gzip header probe (bounded; not full-file validation) | supported | synthetic stored-block members and an independently encoded DEFLATE stream in `blendFile.header` | Phase 1 |
| gzip full-container decompression (bytes only; explicit limits) | supported | generated gzip members around `empty.blend` and decoded corpus bytes; stored-block and independent DEFLATE vectors in `blendFile.header`; no Blender-written gzip fixture | Phase 1 |
| Zstandard header probe (bounded; not full-file validation) | supported | `blendFile.header`; `corpus/blender-5.2.2/Untitled.blend` | Phase 0 |
| Zstandard full-container decompression (bytes only; explicit limits) | supported | `corpus/blender-5.2.2/Untitled.blend`; raw frames around `empty.blend`; checksum and RLE vectors in `blendFile.header` | Phase 1 |
| full-file input, output, ratio and window limits | supported | exact byte/ratio boundaries, high-ratio streams, oversized windows and invalid limits in `blendFile.header` | Phase 1 |
| SDNA | — | | Phase 1 |
| `blend_inspect` | — | | Phase 1 |

Full-stream byte reading validates compression and the decoded header, not
blocks, `ENDB` or SDNA. It does not change the importer's header-only path.
Caller-supplied limits and their semantics are defined in the
[blend contract](../design/BLEND_CONTRACT.md#41-full-stream-byte-reading);
production defaults remain the open BLEND-O5 decision in that document.
